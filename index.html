            Software development is increasing rapidly in industry for the
            development of software systems for diverse fields and it
            continuously becoming a complex task (Hneif & Hockow, 2009). Over
            the last decade, this trend has significantly increased the
            importance of software engineering because now software has become
            an important component for every successful business. With the
            continuously increasing business demands and globalization trends

        <h1>AIM OF MY LIFE  </h1>
        <h3>I WANA BEACOME THE KNOWN PERSON TO ALL DEVELOPER AS A SUCCESFULL DEVELOPER</h3>
        <P>I aspire to choose this very bright career option because it is very easy to become a Software Developer/Programmer and
        it brings quick success, wealth and a glamorous life. But it also requires passion and a keen interest towards coding
        which I possess. People who find coding very dull should not choose this career path. The job role requires you to spend
        hours sitting down at a desk and apply your analytical and reasoning skills nonstop to write lengthy pieces of error
        free and reliable code to develop software programs. There are various programming languages and related fields that you
        can choose from and gain expertise in order to find a job of your preference. India is famous for giving the world a lot
        of software engineers. CEO’s of technology giants like Microsoft, Google etc. are all Indians.We have contributed
        significantly to this field. Sadly, today Software Engineering has become a profession chosen by people merely for the
        glamour and label and not for the actual work. Students are forced to choose it as their profession even if they don’t
        want to since everybody wants their children to become software engineers. They are judged on the basis of grades,
        percentage and bookish knowledge and not by talent. With too many Software Engineers graduating each year, the
        profession has lost its charm and face value. There has also been a certain amount of disinterest among students since
        there are not enough jobs for all in the market. Students with real passion for coding are not given jobs nor even a
        chance to show their skill because they are judged on marks. From being a respectable and booming profession it has been
        reduced to just another degree. One must remember to choose a profession only with passion. We must shun societal norms
        and myths and choose the face value of a job. Respect every job because each one has a special place in society.

            However, as language changes, artificial rules are imposed, creating what is known as a cobweb of worries. Linguists
            have discovered that certain styles are of speech are appropriate for certain situations. For example, while someone
            might speak in a colloquial way around friends and acquaintances, they will switch to more formal speak when in polite

            <P>According to CareerOneStop, about ten percent of software developers either have no college degrees, or only have high
            school diplomas. The creative aspect generated behind computer programs are made by software developers. Some develop
            the virtual systems that run society’s gadgets or control networks. Other software developers make applications that
            enable people to perform certain tasks on a device. If someone wanted to be a software developer, they have to have
            expertise in computers and electronics, engineering and technology, mathematics, telecommunications, and design. They
            would also have to perform tasks such as developing and modifying software to meet user’s needs, making sure that the
            software runs correctly…show more content…
